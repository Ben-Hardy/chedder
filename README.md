# chedder
Python wrapper for chdman for batch converting ISOs, BIN/CUEs to CHD

Requirements: you need to have `chdman` installed since Chedder is built upon it.

It's pretty simple to use:

To convert all ISOs and CUEs in the current directory along with subdirectories to CHD:
`chedder all`

To convert all ISOs in the current directory and subdirectories to CHD:
`chedder all-isos`

To convert all CUE/BIN combos in the current directory and subdirectories to CHD:
`chedder all-cues`

To see all options:
`chedder help`
